# Architecting Teams

As a general point, I'm thinking of a team as "the people you work regularly with, usually daily".

1. How big is your current team, and what is your current goal?
1. How do you keep track of your team's goals? And the company goals?
1. How does you team manage risk to and changes to those goals?
1. How would you describe the best team you've worked on?
1. What made that team different?
1. What do you change about your current team?
1. How well would your current team survive a conflict?
1. Have you ever felt unsafe in a team?
1. Should teams change when projects change?
1. How does the culture of a team change as it grows?
1. Do you recruit to enforce the current culture or diversify it?
1. How diverse is your current team?
