# Architecting Teams

As a general point, I'm thinking of a team as "the people you work regularly with, usually daily".

1. How do you keep track of your team and the company goals?
1. How does your team manage risk to and changes to those goals?
1. What makes a great team?
1. What would you change about your current team?
1. What makes you feel unsafe in a team? 
1. How well would your current team survive a conflict?
1. Should teams change when projects change?
1. How does the culture of a team change as it grows?
1. What kinds of diversity should we seek in the teams we work in? 
1. Should we recruit to enforce the current culture or diversify it?
1. What one thing can a leader do to make a team great?
1. Are effective teams a democracy or a dictatorship?
